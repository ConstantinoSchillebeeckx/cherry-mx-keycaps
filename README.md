# cherry-mx-keycaps

This repo contains 3D models of Cherry MX keycaps; widths included 1x1 through 1x2.5 for rows R1 through R4.

Dimensions were based off of those provided on the [wasdkeyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/) site as well as manualy checking them with calipers.

The .step file located in this root directory contains all the keys listed above; the [STL](/STL) directory contains files for each individual key for use in 3D printing (saved with *medium* refinement).
